These are just some coding exercises from the series of [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

The exercises are done in JavaScript, the language I am most confortable with.
They are accompanied by tests (using Jest test runner).

`npm t` starts the test suite in the watch mode.

`npx babel-node src/<name of file>` will hopefully return the answers to the puzzle.
